# Note taking software
* Would love something simple that provides a plus and minus counter interface beyond a checkbox. I can't think of implementing a figure without a program or just manually updating the count. 
* Would love to have something that would generate a map for me and I can mark the map.

## SimpleNote
SimpleNote is my optional. Notes here are immedidately available on my phone. 

Checkboxes and internal links
* Groceries/Essentials
* Restaurant Orders
* Software Kit

## Dropbox Paper
Allows for more organization and styling, but isn't available in my work network. 

* Dragon Quest Monsters: Dark Prince
* Fire Emblem Heroes
    * Seals

## GitHub
Allows for a lot of flexibility but has to be committed and pushed into the repository to be available on my phone.

* YouTube Music Links
