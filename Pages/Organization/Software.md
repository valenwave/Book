# Note taking software
* Would love something simple that provides a plus and minus counter interface beyond a checkbox. I can't think of implementing a figure without a program or just manually updating the count. 
* Would love to have something that would generate a map for me and I can mark the map.

## SimpleNote
One-off notes that I might want to refer back to when I want to search for it. 

### Checklist
If I want a single document checklist
* Grocery list: Checklist of necessities and whether I need more or not.
