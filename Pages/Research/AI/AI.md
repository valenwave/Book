## Why does water evaporate at room temperature?

Water evaporates at room temperature because of a combination of two factors:

Kinetic Energy of Water Molecules:  Water molecules are constantly in motion, vibrating and bouncing around. This movement creates what's called kinetic energy. At any given temperature, some water molecules will have higher kinetic energy than others.

Intermolecular Forces:  Water molecules are attracted to each other through hydrogen bonding, a special type of intermolecular force.  However, these attractions aren't infinitely strong.

Here's how these factors come together to cause evaporation:

High Energy Molecules Escape: The water molecules with the highest kinetic energy are constantly trying to escape the liquid phase. At room temperature, some of these high-energy molecules have enough energy to overcome the hydrogen bonds holding them to their neighboring molecules.
Breaking Free: When a high-energy molecule overcomes the intermolecular forces, it escapes the liquid surface and enters the gas phase as water vapor.
Key Points:

Temperature and Evaporation: While higher temperatures generally increase the kinetic energy of molecules and lead to faster evaporation, it can still happen at room temperature because some water molecules always have enough energy to escape.
Surface Area: The larger the surface area of the water, the more molecules are exposed to the air and have the opportunity to escape, thus increasing the rate of evaporation.
Humidity: The amount of water vapor already present in the air (humidity) also affects evaporation. If the air is very humid (already saturated with water vapor), evaporation will slow down because there's less room for additional water molecules to enter the gas phase.
In summary, water molecules in constant motion, with some having enough energy to overcome the intermolecular forces at room temperature, is why water evaporates even at room temperature. The rate of evaporation is then influenced by factors like surface area and humidity.

## Can my other team members on Trello see the lists I collapsed?

No, your other team members on Trello cannot see the lists you collapsed. When you collapse a list in Trello, it only affects your individual view of the board. Other team members will see all lists expanded by default.

Trello currently doesn't have a feature that synchronizes collapsed lists across users. This means any customization you make to your board view, including collapsing lists, is specific to you.

Here's a breakdown of what happens when you collapse a list:

Your View: The list title and cards within it are hidden, minimizing clutter and helping you focus on specific parts of the board.
Teammates' View: Other team members will still see the collapsed list title on the board. Clicking on the collapsed title will expand the list and show all its cards, just like it normally appears.
Workarounds and Alternatives:

While there's no direct way to share collapsed list views, here are some workarounds you and your team can consider:

Filters: Trello offers filters that allow you to hide specific cards based on criteria like labels or members assigned. This can help you focus on relevant information without collapsing entire lists.
Custom Boards: If you have a personal workflow that relies heavily on collapsed lists, you can create a separate board for yourself and keep the main team board with all lists expanded for better collaboration.
Board Sections: Trello's board sections can be a good way to organize lists visually. You can group related lists together and potentially collapse entire sections to reduce clutter while maintaining a shared view for your team.
Communication: Discuss your reasoning for collapsing lists with your team. Maybe there's a way to achieve a similar focus through filtering or using board sections collaboratively.
By exploring these alternatives and fostering open communication with your team, you can find ways to manage your Trello board effectively without impacting the visibility for your colleagues.

## I found a soft spot inside my apple. What happened?

A soft spot inside your apple could be caused by a few different things. Here are some possibilities:

Soggy Breakdown: This is a physiological disorder that occurs when apples are stored at temperatures below their ideal range. It's more common in certain apple varieties like Honeycrisp. Symptoms include browning and softening of the flesh, often in a ring-shaped pattern around the core or just under the skin.
Bruising: If the apple received a physical impact during picking, transportation, or storage, it might develop a soft spot at the point of impact. The flesh might also be brown or discolored.
Insect Damage: Apple maggots are a type of insect that can burrow into apples and lay eggs. The feeding activity of the maggot can cause soft spots and browning around the affected area.
Fungal Disease: Fungal diseases like black rot or blue mold can cause softening and spoilage of the apple flesh. You might also notice other signs like discoloration or mold growth on the surface.
Here's how to determine the cause and what to do with your apple:

Examine the Spot: Look closely at the soft area. Is it brown or discolored? Are there any visible holes or insects?
Smell the Apple: Does the soft spot have an off odor? Spoiled apples often develop a sour or fermented smell.
Cut Around the Spot: If the soft area is small and contained, you can try cutting away the affected flesh and enjoying the rest of the apple.
Discard Spoiled Apples: If the soft spot is large, discolored, or has an unpleasant odor, it's best to discard the entire apple to avoid consuming potential toxins or bacteria.
Here are some tips for preventing soft spots in your apples:

Buy apples that are firm and free of bruises.
Store apples in your refrigerator crisper drawer. The ideal temperature for storing apples is around 30-35 degrees Fahrenheit (-1 to 2 degrees Celsius).
Keep apples away from other fruits and vegetables that emit ethylene gas, such as bananas or pears. Ethylene gas can accelerate ripening and softening of apples.
Eat your apples within a reasonable timeframe. Apples don't last forever, and even under ideal storage conditions, they will eventually soften and spoil.
By understanding the potential causes of soft spots and following proper storage practices, you can enjoy crisp and delicious apples for longer.
