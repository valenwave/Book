## Fever

A child has a fever when the temperature is at or above one of these levels:
100.4°F (38°C) measured in the bottom (rectally)
99.5°F (37.5°C) measured in the mouth (orally)
99°F (37.2°C) measured under the arm (axillary)

An adult probably has a fever when the temperature is above 99°F to 99.5°F (37.2°C to 37.5°C), depending on the time of day.
