- Wash hands for 20 seconds with soap and running water before preparing food, before eating, and after using the toilet or changing a child's diaper.
- Don't leave food out for 2 hours or longer (or 1 hour if the food is exposed to temperature above 90F)

## Gardening

According to the Farmers' Almanac, the last frost date in Grand Rapids, Michigan is May 14, 2024, with a 30% chance of frost occurring after that date. However, these dates are based on historical data and are not guaranteed. You should check weather forecasts before planting.

## Hardboiled eggs

- Fresh: Older eggs tend to peel tougher than fresher ones. If you can, use eggs that are at > a week  and < 3 weeks
- Gentle cook: A rolling boil can cause the whites to stick to the shell more.
- The Shell Trick: Before cooking, gently tap the eggs on the counter to create small cracks all over the shell.
- Cold Start: Boil, remove from heat, sit for 10-12 minutes.
- The Ice Bath: Transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice water for at least 10 minutes.

## Leftovers

- Eating leftovers within 3 or 4 days is a challenge. If you plan on making lunch prep for the week on Sunday, that leaves Friday with no leftovers. Also, a good way to enforce the time duration for the leftovers is to date when the food is made with scotch tape.
