# Diagrams.net
## Pros
* Copy and paste from clipboard
* Save sections into Scratchpad for re-use.
* Scratchpad persist between documents.

## Cons
* Not a very good mobile presence.

# MediaWiki vs. GitLab Wiki
## GitLab Wiki
* Can insert screenshots via the `CTRL+V` shortcut
* Can use Markdown

# MindMeister
Supports up to 3 mind maps on the free version. This is enough for me at the moment. I just have the one map to use for planning out team meetings. 

# Notes
## Dropbox Paper
* Checkboxes

### Web App
Needs further evaluation

### Mobile App
* Creating a new to a new document doesn't automatically link and just creates the document with the new title. You'll have to still go back and re-link. 

#### Upgrade from SimpleNote
* Whenever I want to have different size headers. 
* Whenever I want to have interlinking notes. 

## SimpleNote
* Checkboxes
* Better to use a collection of Markdown files for organizing linking pages. 

## Visual Studio Code
* A Markdown and Wiki alone won't give the ability to check/uncheck items off a list dynamically.
