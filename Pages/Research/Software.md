## Pros
* Copy and paste from clipboard
* Save sections into Scratchpad for re-use.
* Scratchpad persist between documents.

## Cons
* Not a very good mobile presence.

# MediaWiki vs. GitLab Wiki
## GitLab Wiki
* Can insert screenshots via the `CTRL+V` shortcut
* Can use Markdown

# MindMeister
Supports up to 3 mind maps on the free version. This is enough for me at the moment. I just have the one map to use for planning out team meetings. 

# Notes
## Dropbox Paper
[x] Has a 
* Checkboxes: Handles checkboxes as tasks and crosses out the item when checked. SimpleNote has checkboxes as well but handles them differently. Both has different applications.
* Linking: Both SimpleNote and Dropbox Paper is good at linking pages. The disadvantage of linking with a Markdown collection is automatically setting the file path to each file. A file path which can be broken if the file moves. This isn't an issue with SimpleNote or Dropbox Paper though. 
* Link jumping: Going from page to page is pretty slow. It is faster in SimpleNote. 
* Links to existing pages doesn't always appear to be an option. At least in mobile. I really hope I can overcome this problem or else the linking becomes unusable. I can only hope that it is better on the web version. 

### Web App
Needs further evaluation

### Mobile App
* Creating a new to a new document doesn't automatically link and just creates the document with the new title. You'll have to still go back and re-link. 
* It would be quicker to create pages and link to them with a full keyboard and quick access to CTRL+X, CTRL+V

#### Upgrade from SimpleNote
* Whenever I want to have different size headers. 
* Whenever I want to have interlinking notes. 

## SimpleNote
* Checkboxes
* Linking: Both SimpleNote and Dropbox Paper is good at linking pages. The disadvantage of linking with a Markdown collection is automatically setting the file path to each file. A file path which can be broken if the file moves. This isn't an issue with SimpleNote or Dropbox Paper though. 
* Links are more verbose than Dropbox Paper.

## Visual Studio Code
* A Markdown and Wiki alone won't give the ability to check/uncheck items off a list dynamically. 
* I can silo my pages into folders.  Whereas, in Dropbox, there are a lot of pages to sort through. Especially, if I'm planning to make a page per creature.
