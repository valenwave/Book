# Diagrams.net
## Pros
* Copy and paste from clipboard
* Save sections into Scratchpad for re-use.
* Scratchpad persist between documents.

## Cons
* Not a very good mobile presence.

# MediaWiki vs. GitLab Wiki
## GitLab Wiki
* Can insert screenshots via the `CTRL+V` shortcut
* Can use Markdown

# MindMeister
Supports up to 3 mind maps on the free version. This is enough for me at the moment. I just have the one map to use for planning out team meetings. 

# Notes
## Dropbox Paper
* Checkboxes: Handles checkboxes as tasks. Philosophy is that you check items that you no longer have to think about (but still visible if you want to focus on it)
* Linking: Both SimpleNote and Dropbox Paper is good at linking pages. The disadvantage of linking with a Markdown collection is automatically setting the file path to each file. A file path which can be broken if the file moves. This isn't an issue with SimpleNote or Dropbox Paper though. 
* Link jumping: Negative. Going from page to page is pretty slow. It is faster in SimpleNote. 
* Internal links: Negative. Links to existing pages doesn't always appear to be an option. At least in mobile. I really hope I can overcome this problem or else the linking becomes unusable.
* Search: Negative. Something is off about the search. I can create a new file with text and search for the text and it won't show up in the search results. Maybe there's a delay, but the delay doesn't exist on SimpleNote. 

### Upgrade from SimpleNote
* Whenever I want to have different size headers. 
* Whenever I want to have interlinking notes. 

### Limitations
* Checking a check box will strike out the item
* Color coding

## SimpleNote
* Linking: Both SimpleNote and Dropbox Paper is good at linking pages. The disadvantage of linking with a Markdown collection is automatically setting the file path to each file. A file path which can be broken if the file moves. This isn't an issue with SimpleNote or Dropbox Paper though. 
* Links are more verbose than Dropbox Paper.
* Tag removals: Negative. I can normally delete tags, but there are some tags I can't delete for some reason. 

### Checkboxes
* Handles checkboxes as makers. I like using this version for groceries, because I have a list of all items that I might enjoy having and I check the items that I actually need to get.
* Freedom to choose whether you want an item crossed out by using the strikeout Markdown syntax, and the Markdown preview mode. 

## Visual Studio Code
* A Markdown and Wiki alone won't give the ability to check/uncheck items off a list dynamically. 
* I can silo my pages into folders.  Whereas, in Dropbox, there are a lot of pages to sort through. Especially, if I'm planning to make a page per creature. 

## Google Docs
Doesn't have checkboxes. 

# Visual Studio
* Lowercase: CTRL+U
* Uppercase: CTRL+SHIFT+U
