Benefits from having small searchable documents. It's UI relies on using search to find documents and the search works well. Including notes here that I don't want to be public or information that others wouldn't care about.

## Usage

Would I want to go back and reference it?

* Shopping list
* Restaurant journal
* Health journal
* Social journal
* Frequency updated notes
* Quick temporary notes

## Negatives

Not very good with internal links. Dropbox Paper is ideal for this. Linking is possible if you start with the `[` character, but links some times includes an endline character that needs to be corrected after the auto insert. The link is only clickable in preview mode, but if you click on a link with this method, you get out of preview mode. This makes traversal not ideal.

Check boxes in published mode does not look good. There's no left margin and the check box items are further left than the headers.

* Mobile Preview: When using preview mode on the phone, check boxes doesn't load correctly. But links still works.
