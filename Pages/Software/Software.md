## Dropbox Paper

Linking vs. Markdown

- It's slightly easier to make internal links with Dropbox Paper. But it's also that not bad and is better than Evernote.

## Evernote

Vs. Markdown

- I kinda like how I can paste images here and see a thumbail of the image. It doesn't overwhelm the document and I can see more if the image if I want to.
- It's nice that I can see the table of contents here. I don't have that ability in Evernote.
- It's so easy to just clip something and save on Evernote, but I think when I'm ready to organize my notes, it is better to keep it here.

## Markdown

I'm enjoying Markdown for notes with interconnecting links.

## Task Applications

I like now Google Task handle recurring tasks. I use Any.Do for everything else.
