## Dropbox Paper

Linking vs. Markdown

- It's slightly easier to make internal links with Dropbox Paper. But it's also that not bad and is better than Evernote.

## Evernote

Vs. Markdown

- I kinda like how I can paste images here and see a thumbail of the image. It doesn't overwhelm the document and I can see more if the image if I want to.
- It's nice that I can see the table of contents here. I don't have that ability in Evernote.
- It's so easy to just clip something and save on Evernote, but I think when I'm ready to organize my notes, it is better to keep it here.
- Portal: Instead of a collection of bookmarks, it makes a great place to organize links.
- Portal/Wiki: Sitemap of some of the useful pages from our internal wiki.

## Google Keep

- Can take pictures on the phone with the volume buttons.
- Labels as the mean of organization.
- Negative: Can't rotate images.

## Media Wiki

Not my favorite tool. Markup is not as great as Markdown, but is the place to put notes that I want my team to have access to. I need to move some of the stuff from my Markdown Work Notebook to it.

Has a template system that is good to enforce standards onto other team members. Whenever I'm working on a page that is based on a template and I make a new section, I consider putting that section back into the template.

## My Markdown Book

I'm enjoying Markdown for notes with interconnecting links. I'm also starting to really like using it for image notes. Finalized place for organized thoughts and notes that I would want to share.

## Simplenote

Benefits from having small searchable documents. It's UI relies on using search to find documents and the search works well. Including notes here that I don't want to be public or information that others wouldn't care about.
