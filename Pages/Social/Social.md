## Gender Identity

One should be able to infer a person's identity by their body features, voice, or name. Having to ask for their gender and that gender being different than what was perceive is counter intuitive and creates dissonance. I don't think I will ever get used to it.

## Listen

Listen when someone wants to speak. They're passionate about something or they want to ask for help. Speak when you have something new you want to add to the conversation.

## Parenting

Having two kids opens my eyes that everyone is going to struggle with different things. Not everything is dependant on the external environment. Some behavior is generic and behavior is not going to be the same for all kids.

## Pointing out Health

I like to think that I'm health conscience. It doesn't feel good for someone to tell me I'm fat when I'm feeling hungry. It would also wouldn't feel good if someone told me I need to work out if I'm tired. Something to keep in mind of when speaking to others.

## Religion

I'm not a believer who feels I have done extensive research on religion and faith. I feel there are different flavors of believers. Group 1 are those that believe that the world is truely magical and diviely guided by the act of God. I believe that the more one learns about the world, the more they come to the realization that there is automation in all of life. Group 2 are those that believe that God speaks to them and guides them when they make prayers. This I come to take as self-reflection. I take the time to reflect, to prioritize and determine how to best use my time too. I think this group convinced themselves that their conclusions during their self reflection was given to them by God. I can't put them down for feeling that they have found a sense of purpose and have associated that to their religion. Group 3 is fear. Can't reason with that.
