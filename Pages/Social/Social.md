## Gender Identity

One should be able to infer a person's identity by their body features, voice, or name. Having to ask for their gender and that gender being different than what was perceive is counter intuitive and creates dissonance. I don't think I will ever get used to it.

## Listen

Listen when someone wants to speak. They're passionate about something or they want to ask for help. Speak when you have something new you want to add to the conversation.

## Parenting

Having two kids opens my eyes that everyone is going to struggle with different things. Not everything is dependant on the external environment. Some behavior is generic and behavior is not going to be the same for all kids.

## Pointing out Health

I like to think that I'm health conscience. It doesn't feel good for someone to tell me I'm fat when I'm feeling hungry. It would also wouldn't feel good if someone told me I need to work out if I'm tired. Something to keep in mind of when speaking to others.

## Relationships

There was a fantasy growing up that I would find a women some day that would take all my burdens away. I think a lot of it stems from the Disney channel, and I think it gets presented for both genders. It's a give and take. A relationship can only happen if you're strong enough to take some of the burdens of the other. Only then will you have some of your own burdens taken away.
