# Religion

I'm not a believer who feels I have done extensive research on religion and faith. I feel there are different flavors of believers. Group 1 are those that believe that the world is truely magical and diviely guided by the act of God. I believe that the more one learns about the world, the more they come to the realization that there is automation in all of life. Group 2 are those that believe that God speaks to them and guides them when they make prayers. This I come to take as self-reflection. I take the time to reflect, to prioritize and determine how to best use my time too. I think this group convinced themselves that their conclusions during their self reflection was given to them by God. I can't put them down for feeling that they have found a sense of purpose and have associated that to their religion. Group 3 is fear. Can't reason with that.

## Voice of God

It's dangerous to say that the voice in your head is the voice of God. Immortal acts are enabled by the belief that an external source is requesting action. Many bible groups would pair concept that the thoughts has be an echo from the bible to know that it is advised by God. Fair failsafe, but I feel it's limiting. There are lot of good literature and lot of good viewpoints to get advise from.
