## How does Rick control the central finite curve?

Rick doesn't directly control the Central Finite Curve in the way you might think. Here's the breakdown:

The Curve's Function: The Central Finite Curve is a walled garden within the infinite multiverse. It contains realities where a Rick exists, specifically realities where Rick is the smartest being.
Accidental Creation: The show doesn't delve deeply into the Curve's origin, but it's hinted that Rick's portal gun technology and the actions of various Ricks unintentionally created this section.
Self-Fulfilling System: The Curve maintains itself by filtering access. Portal guns are tuned to only travel within the Curve, ensuring Ricks remain the smartest beings they encounter.
Council of Ricks: Rick C-137 (our Rick) might have been involved in the early development of the Citadel, a Rick-run society within the Curve. However, other Ricks took control and maintain the status quo.
So, Rick benefits from the Curve but doesn't directly control it.  Evil Morty, however, figured out the Curve's limitations and escaped it in the season 5 finale, potentially shattering the system Rick thrived in.

## Who are the main characters in Spy x Family?

The main characters in Spy x Family are:

Loid Forger (Twilight): A master Westalian spy who takes on the undercover identity of psychiatrist Loid Forger. His mission, Operation Strix, requires him to create a seemingly perfect family in order to infiltrate an elite private school and get close to a high-ranking official.

Yor Forger (Thorn Princess):  A skilled assassin with a hidden identity who becomes Loid's pretend wife.  Yor unknowingly agrees to the marriage to maintain her cover and a place to stay.

Anya Forger:  A young telepathic girl who escapes a secret government facility. Anya isn't aware of Loid and Yor's secret identities but uses her mind-reading abilities to help them with their missions while also trying to fit in as a normal child.

Bond Forger (later in the story):  A stray dog Loid adopts who turns out to be a precognitive Great Dane with the ability to see glimpses of the future.

These four characters form the core of the Forger family, and the story revolves around their unique dynamic, their attempts to maintain their secret identities, and the challenges and humor that arise from their unconventional family life.

## Billiards

Billiards and pool are related but not exactly the same. Here's the breakdown of why billiards is also sometimes called pool:

Billiards is the broader term: Billiards refers to any cue sport played on a table with balls and a cue stick. This encompasses various games like carom billiards (where the goal is to carom, or hit, two or more balls together), snooker, and pool itself.

Pool refers specifically to pocket billiards: Pool, also known as pocket billiards, is a specific type of billiards game played on a table with pockets. The objective is to pot (sink) your assigned balls into designated pockets using the cue ball.

The Origin of "Pool":

The term "pool" in relation to billiards likely comes from the 19th century and the rise of poolrooms. These were establishments where people could gather to play billiards, gamble on horse races, and socialize.

Connection to Gambling:  Back then, the word "pool"  referred to a collective bet or stake placed in gambling games like horse racing. Pool halls often had billiards tables, and patrons might play a few rounds between races.

Shifting Terminology: Over time, the term "pool" became associated specifically with the billiards games played in these pool halls, particularly pocket billiards which was the most popular variation.

So, why the confusion?

Pool Became Synonymous with Billiards:  In many parts of the world, especially North America, "pool" became synonymous with pocket billiards, the most common game played on billiards tables. People started using "pool" as a general term for any game played on a pool table, even if it wasn't technically a "pool" game according to the broader definition of billiards.

Marketing and Popularity: The widespread popularity of pool tables and games like eight-ball pool further solidified the use of "pool" as a catch-all term for billiards, especially in casual settings.

In essence:

Billiards is the umbrella term for cue sports played on a table.
Pool specifically refers to pocket billiards games played on a table with pockets.
The term "pool" became widely used to refer to billiards in general, due to the historical association with pool halls and the popularity of pocket billiards games.

## What does behind the 8 ball mean?

The expression "behind the eight ball" is a common idiom that means someone is in a difficult, unfavorable, or troublesome situation. It often implies a feeling of being stuck or having limited options.

Here's the origin of the expression:

Billiards Connection: It's thought to be derived from the game of eight-ball pool, where the eight ball (the black ball) is the one that needs to be pocketed last to win the game.

Literal Meaning: If the cue ball (the ball you hit) lands between your object balls and the eight ball, it can be difficult or even impossible to make a successful shot without accidentally pocketing the eight ball early and losing the game.
Figurative Meaning: This situation became a metaphor for being in a tricky spot where any action you take might lead to a worse outcome.
Alternative Theory:  Another theory suggests the expression comes from the scoring system in a now-obscure pool game called kelly pool, where balls numbered higher than eight were considered "behind" and thus disadvantaged.

How the expression is used:

"Sarah missed her deadline again and is now behind the eight ball with her boss."
"The company's finances are in trouble, and they're looking for ways to get out from behind the eight ball."
"He found himself behind the eight ball after the car broke down in the middle of nowhere."
In essence:

Behind the eight ball is a colorful idiom that conveys a sense of difficulty, disadvantage, or being stuck in a tough situation.
