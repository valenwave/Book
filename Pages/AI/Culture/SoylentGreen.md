# Soylent Green

## What are some movies inspired by Soylent Green?

The 1973 dystopian sci-fi film "Soylent Green" sparked a wave of movies exploring similar themes of overpopulation, resource depletion, and the ethics of food production in a future teetering on the brink. Here are some notable examples:

Westworld (1973): Released in the same year as Soylent Green, Westworld explores a futuristic amusement park populated by android "hosts" catering to wealthy guests' desires.  Both films grapple with the consequences of unchecked technological advancement and humanity's disconnect from nature.

Blade Runner (1982): This neo-noir classic dives into a Los Angeles of the future where replicants, bioengineered beings nearly indistinguishable from humans, are used for dangerous labor.  Similar to Soylent Green, it questions what defines humanity and the ethical implications of dependence on artificial solutions.

Snowpiercer (2013): Set on a constantly moving train carrying the last remnants of humanity after a climate catastrophe, Snowpiercer portrays the stark divide between the elite living in luxury and the impoverished masses relegated to harsh conditions in the tail end of the train.  This class struggle mirrors the resource disparity hinted at in Soylent Green.

The Hunger Games (2012):  In this dystopian saga set in Panem, a nation built on the ashes of North America, children are forced to fight to the death in an annual televised event.  The film explores themes of food scarcity, government control, and rebellion against a tyrannical regime, echoing elements of Soylent Green's social commentary.

High-Rise (2015): Based on J.G. Ballard's novel, High-Rise depicts a luxurious high-rise apartment building that descends into chaos as social norms disintegrate and residents become increasingly self-absorbed.  The film explores themes of class warfare, societal collapse, and the potential dangers of unchecked consumerism, which can be seen as a precursor to the situation in Soylent Green.

WALL*E (2008):  This Pixar animated film features a lonely robot tasked with cleaning up a future Earth ravaged by pollution and consumer waste. WALL*E's discovery of a surviving plant becomes a symbol of hope for a return to a more sustainable way of life.  The film critiques humanity's wasteful habits and the potential consequences of environmental neglect, themes also present in Soylent Green.

These are just a few examples, and the influence of Soylent Green can be seen in many other dystopian films. The enduring themes of resource scarcity, environmental degradation, and the struggle for survival in a future shaped by human choices continue to resonate with audiences today.
