They recommended that we stop putting peels in the garbage disposal. and that we limit the size of items to about the size of corn. They also routed the dishwasher tube into the garbage disposal instead of the piping because they said that was the correct way. They also said they think the garbage disposal only has half a year of life left because it's rusting.
