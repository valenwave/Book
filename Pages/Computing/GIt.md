# Git

## Progress commits

When you finished a feature and want to save changes. Look at all of the files that you touched and review the changes one at a time. Resolve any loose ends on the files you touched like TODO comments, and stage each file. Once all files have been reviewed and staged. Make your commit.

## Resurrecting a branch

If you're resurrecting a branch that has already been merged into develop or has not yet had a commit, update the branch by using the fast forward option.

## Stashing

If you haven't completed a thought yet and have to switch branches, avoid a partial commit. Stash the changes. When you're ready to go back, pop the stash and continue working.
