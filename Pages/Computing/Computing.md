## Bullets

When writing a bulleted list, don't make a single bullet item wrap more than a single line. If it is more, make it a paragraph instead.

## Certificate Permission

For IIS to have access to the certificate. Add IIS_IUSRS to the permission group.

## Simplenote

Simplenote has become my personal wikia. Philosophy is if I want to look up my thoughts on something, I should search it up on my Simplenote. If I want to update my thoughts on it, update it. If a thought is getting too big, note to an external document. I'm not a fan of how Simplenote does linking, so I don't even bother creating a link.
