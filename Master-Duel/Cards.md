# Angel Trumpeter
* Angel Trumpeter + [Level 4 Normal Monster](/Master-Duel/Master-Duel.md#level-4-normal-monster) = Magikey Spirit - Vepartu

# Baby Mudragon
* I don't think I'll miss this card. 

# Burning Soul
* An example is Stardust Dragon or Baronne de Fleur.
* I would need a reason to want to Synchro summon on my opponent's turn to use this, or be on the attack and the opponent decide to play a trap that would destroy my monsters. Situational. 

# Dinowrestler Pankraptops
* I can destroy an opponent card or I can use it for it's ATK which is higher than Dark Magician

# Eldich the Golden Lord
* If I have any Spell or Traps in my deck, it's always nice to have the option to have Eldich the Golden Lord use it to destroy an opponent card instead. 

# Fleur
## Chevalier de Fleur
* [Fleur Synchron](#level-2-fleur-synchron) + Level 6
* With Junk Speeder and Jet Synchron to Stardust Charge Warrior, I can take take a Fleur Synchron to jump to Chevalier de Fleur. However, if I have Junk Speeder, I almost always want to go to Baronne de Fleur. Interestingly, Baronne de Fleur can downgrade to Chevalier de Fleur. But, I can also downgrade to Stardust Dragon or Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon.

## Fleuret de Fleur
* Can be used to get any [Level 2](#level-2). It's ability indicate that I synchro summon a monster, I can move this equip spell to that synchro summoned monster.

## Necro Fleur
* If I can find a good way to have it kill itself, I can special summon "Sorciere de Fleur" from my deck. I can't think of a good way. I guess it makes an interesting side effect if my opponent decide they want to kill it to trigger its effect, but it's likely considering that they can just as easily attack it.
* There's a field spell that kills the first incoming monster, this could be a fun combination.

## Necro Synchron
* Necro Synchron + Junk Servant will allow me to get Stardust Charge Warrior. This triggers Necro Synchron and allow me to get a level 1 plant from my deck. It sounds like the plant they want me to get is [Necro Fleur](#necro-fleur)

## Noble Knight's Spearholder
* Noble Knight's Spearholder can sacrifice itself to get an [Equip Spell](#equip-spell). With the [Equip Spell](#equip-spell) Fleuret de Fleur, you can get back Noble Knight's Spearholder but it loses its ability to turn itself into a tuner. Not very useful. You could also instead get another Fleur as they are mostly level 2. But that is just extra steps. Might be good if you're trying to thin the deck or get a bonus from triggering an extra spell. My favorite equip spell to get with this effect is Power of Guardians.
* It can turn another monster into Fleur Synchron before sacrificing itself.

## Sorciere de Fleur
* Can cheat in with [Necro Fleur](#necro-fleur), but I don't think it's worth it considering it is a dead card in head if I draw Sorciere de Fleur or if I even draw Necro Fleur without a way to self-destruct it.

# Junk
## Junk Archer
* I can synchro summon this with [Quickdraw Synchron](#quickdraw-synchron) and Quillbolt Hedgehog, but ending a combo at Junk Archer isn't thrilling. 

## Junk Connector
* Junk Speeder
* Junk Destroyer
* Junk Archer
* Junk Warrior
* Junk Berserker
* Junk Gardna

## Junk Destroyer
* If I make this a stepping stone between Junk Speeder to Baronne de Fleur, I can get one extra destruction in. However, I would normally step to Nitro Warrior to get an extra draw in instead. Depends on whether I'm going first or second then. Junk Destroyer if second and the opponent has a monster and Nitro Warrior if first.

## Junk Speeder
* Could provide the resources for a [Double Tribute](/Master-Duel/Master-Duel.md#double-tribute). If I decide to use them, Chronograph Sorcerer provides another way to get them out. 

# Lightning Storm
* Not great if I depend on Field Spells, Continous Spell or Traps, or Pendulum monsters. 
* With Junk Speeder, I have some Continous Spells that helps me keep my combo going. 

# Monster Reborn
* I can bring back Dinowrestler Pankraptops and use it's effect again. 
* I can special summon Starry Night, Starry Dragon if I happen to get it in the graveyard. 
* I can bring back a monster that was destroyed to continue my combo.

# One for One
* Tuningware

# Stardust
## Converging Wishes
* I've never been able to summon 5 Dragon Synchron monsters. 

## Majestic Absorption
* Might be fun to try out. 

## Majestic Mirage
* Even if my conditions are met, I still would have to depend on my opponent triggering it. 

## Shooting Star
* I have more reliable ways of triggering a destruction. 

## Shooting Star Dragon
* Stardust Dragon + Formula Synchron
* Crystron Halqifibrax can bring out Formula Synchron on the opponent's turn and Formula Synchron can trigger a synchro summon on the opponent's turn. 

## Stardust Assault Warrior
* Junk Forward + Junk Synchron into Stardust Assault Warrior. Get back Junk Synchron to make a Level 9 Synchro monster. I don't have a such a monster that I care about. 

## Stardust Chronicle Spark Dragon
* I don't see why I would play this over Shooting Star Dragon. And I rarely ever get to play Shooting Star Dragon. 

## Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode
* I hate how if I draw this, it becomes a dead card. It needs to stay in my deck to be useful and I have to have Assault Mode Activate and I have to have Stardust Dragon out. That's a lot of requirements.

## Stardust Flash
* A weaker [Reborn](#reborn)

## Stardust Shimmer
* This seems like a worst Monster Reborn unless I use cards that gains advantage for having cards out of play. 

## Stardust Spark Dragon
* It can survive Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer, but it can't beat it. 
* It's a generally neat card, but I can't think of what I would take out for it. I would rather have Stardust Dragon, Junk Destroyer, and Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon

## Stardust Trail
* What do I have that Tributes? 

## Stardust Wish
* I don't get my Stardust out often enough to use this. 

## Stardust Xiaolong
* This makes an interesting facedown. 
* I can get this from my deck if I draw Converging Wills Dragon and I have a Stardust Dragon on the field. I can get a Majestic Star Dragon from this. 

# Synchron
## Accel Synchron
* What can I gain from throwing a Synchron monster from the deck to graveyard? 

## Bri Synchron
* I don't have my 4s so it could be a nice extra monster with Junk Speeder, but I don't want to normally negate my Synchro monster's effect. 

## Drill Warrior
* Might be able to do something fun with throwing a monster into the graveyard temporarly, but the extra deck is too tight for this. 

## Jet Warrior
* With the same materials, I can make Junk Speeder...

## Junk Berserker
* Junk Synchron + Junk Servant
* Quickdraw Synchron + Quillbolt Hedgehog
* Not easy combos and not great payoff. Extra deck is already tight as is. 

## Mono Synchron
* I can turn my Level 4 or lower Warrior or Machine-Type monsters into materials to make Formula Synchron. 
* I would rather get to Forumla Synchron with Crystron Halqifibrax though. 

## Necro Linker
* Not being able to Synchro summon hinders me, but I guess they want me to Link summon instead. 
* This does become a trigger for [Stardust Trail](#stardust-trail)

## Quickdraw Synchron
* If I discard Quillbolt Hedgehog, I can use Quillbolt Hedgehog's ability to bring it right back for a [Level 7 Synchro Monster that mentions "Synchron" Tuner as material](#level-7-synchro-monster-that-mentions-synchron-tuner-as-material)
* It's one of the only level 5 Synchrons that I can use with Junk Speeder. I can't make much with it, but I can link summon Crystron Halqifibrax, but I have to wait a turn. So, I'm not in love with the idea. 

## Road Synchron
* I like it can become Level 2. It makes an extra Level 2 option for my Junk Speeder. 

### Road Warrior
* I don't see a good way of summoning this guy. 

## Tuning
* I can get Junk Synchron, but I need to already have a level 2 in the graveyard to summon Junk Speeder. Reinforcement of the Army is a better searcher, because I can get Junk Converter. It's still nice to have, it's just not perfect. 

## Turbo Synchron
* I'm fine with having Jet Synchron in my deck. 

### Turbo Warrior
* Interesting effect, I don't think it matters in the current meta. 

# Thunder King Rai-Oh
* It's a nice restriction for the opponent, would be great to use if it didn't hinder me as well. 
* Synchron doesn't depend too much on [Deck to Hand](/Master-Duel.md#deck-to-hand), so it's usable.

# Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier
* This one is not as easy to get out as Crystron Quariongandrax
* Junk Speeder + Quillbolt Hedgehog + [Level 2 Tuner](#level-2-tuner)

# Unexpected Dai
* Galaxy Serpent

# United We Stand
* Junk Speeder can double it's attack to 3600 if I don't want to use it as a stepping stone for a higher Synchro summon. If I put it in my Extra Deck slot, that means I can have 6 monsters for an extra bonus of 4800. That's 8400 total. 

# Ursarctic Septentrion
* Shutsdown non-level decks... Evil Twin. That's not many. 

# Wandering Gryphon Rider
* Wandering Gryphon Rider + Junk Synchron = Baronne de Fleur
* Provides an alternative way to Baronne de Fleur without the need of Junk Synchron. But the extra Synchro summons are fun.
