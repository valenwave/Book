# Soup
* Pasta doesn't make good leftovers, it'll continue to soak up the broth as you reheat it and won't have a good texture.
* Eggs can be scrambled and added to soup to add some protein and texture to the soup. 
* Hard root vegetables are good for soup because the longer you cook the vegetable, the better it is.
