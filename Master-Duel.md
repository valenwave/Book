# Chevalier de Fleur
* [Fleur Synchron](#level-2-fleur-synchron) + Level 6
* With Junk Speeder and Jet Synchron to Stardust Charge Warrior, I can take take a Fleur Synchron to jump to Chevalier de Fleur. However, if I have Junk Speeder, I almost always want to go to Baronne de Fleur. Interestingly, Baronne de Fleur can downgrade to Chevalier de Fleur. But, I can also downgrade to Stardust Dragon or Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon.

# Fleuret de Fleur
* Can be used to get any [Level 2](#level-2). It's ability indicate that I synchro summon a monster, I can move this equip spell to that synchro summoned monster.

# Junk Connector
* Junk Speeder
* Junk Destroyer
* Junk Archer
* Junk Warrior
* Junk Berserker
* Junk Gardna

# Junk Destroyer
* If I make this a stepping stone between Junk Speeder to Baronne de Fleur, I can get one extra destruction in. However, I would normally step to Nitro Warrior to get an extra draw in instead. Depends on whether I'm going first or second then. Junk Destroyer if second and Nitro Warrior if first. 

# One for One
* Tuningware

# Necro Fleur
* If I can find a good way to have it kill itself, I can special summon "Sorciere de Fleur" from my deck. I can't think of a good way. I guess it makes an interesting side effect if my opponent decide they want to kill it to trigger its effect, but it's likely considering that they can just as easily attack it.

# Noble Knight's Spearholder
* Noble Knight's Spearholder can sacrifice itself to get an [Equip Spell](#equip-spell). With the [Equip Spell](#equip-spell) Fleuret de Fleur, you can get back Noble Knight's Spearholder but it loses its ability to turn itself into a tuner. Not very useful. You could also instead get another Fleur as they are mostly level 2. But that is just extra steps. Might be good if you're trying to thin the deck or get a bonus from triggering an extra spell.
* It can turn another monster into Fleur Synchron before sacrificing itself.
