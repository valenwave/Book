# Leftovers
* Eating leftovers within 3 or 4 days is a challenge. If you plan on making lunch prep for the week on Sunday, that leaves Friday with no leftovers. Also, a good way to enforce the time duration for the leftovers is to date when the food is made with scotch tape. 

# Fever
A child has a fever when the temperature is at or above one of these levels:
100.4°F (38°C) measured in the bottom (rectally)
99.5°F (37.5°C) measured in the mouth (orally)
99°F (37.2°C) measured under the arm (axillary)

An adult probably has a fever when the temperature is above 99°F to 99.5°F (37.2°C to 37.5°C), depending on the time of day.
