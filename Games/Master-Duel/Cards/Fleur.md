# Chevalier de Fleur
* [Fleur Synchron](#level-2-fleur-synchron) + Level 6
* With Junk Speeder and Jet Synchron to Stardust Charge Warrior, I can take take a Fleur Synchron to jump to Chevalier de Fleur. However, if I have Junk Speeder, I almost always want to go to Baronne de Fleur. Interestingly, Baronne de Fleur can downgrade to Chevalier de Fleur. But, I can also downgrade to Stardust Dragon or Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon.

# Fleuret de Fleur
* Can be used to get any [Level 2](#level-2). It's ability indicate that I synchro summon a monster, I can move this equip spell to that synchro summoned monster.

# Necro Fleur
* If I can find a good way to have it kill itself, I can special summon "Sorciere de Fleur" from my deck. I can't think of a good way. I guess it makes an interesting side effect if my opponent decide they want to kill it to trigger its effect, but it's likely considering that they can just as easily attack it.
* There's a field spell that kills the first incoming monster, this could be a fun combination.

# Necro Synchron
* Necro Synchron + Junk Servant will allow me to get Stardust Charge Warrior. This triggers Necro Synchron and allow me to get a level 1 plant from my deck. It sounds like the plant they want me to get is [Necro Fleur](#necro-fleur)

# Noble Knight's Spearholder
* Noble Knight's Spearholder can sacrifice itself to get an [Equip Spell](#equip-spell). With the [Equip Spell](#equip-spell) Fleuret de Fleur, you can get back Noble Knight's Spearholder but it loses its ability to turn itself into a tuner. Not very useful. You could also instead get another Fleur as they are mostly level 2. But that is just extra steps. Might be good if you're trying to thin the deck or get a bonus from triggering an extra spell. My favorite equip spell to get with this effect is Power of Guardians.
* It can turn another monster into Fleur Synchron before sacrificing itself.

# Sorciere de Fleur
* Can cheat in with [Necro Fleur](#necro-fleur), but I don't think it's worth it considering it is a dead card in head if I draw Sorciere de Fleur or if I even draw Necro Fleur without a way to self-destruct it.
