# Arrive in Light
* I can't actually activate this card unless I have Converging Wills Dragon in my check, and if I have Converging Wills Dragon, I might as well have Stardust Xiaolong. 
* Can special summon Stardust Synchron with Junk Speeder to get Arrive in Light onto the field. 
* Junk Speeder => Stardust Synchron & Junk Synchron 
    * Stardust Synchron => Arrive in Light
    * Junk Speeder + Junk Synchron => Stardust Dragon
    * Stardust Dragon + Arrive in Light => Converging Wills Dragon 
    * Converging Wills Dragon => Stardust Xiaolong
    * Stardust Dragon + Converging Wills Dragon + Stardust Xiaolong => Majestic Star Dragon
* Junk Speeder => Stardust Synchron & Junk Synchron & [Level 1 Synchron Tuner](Master-Duel.md#level-1-synchron-tuner) & [Level 2 Synchron Tuner](Master-Duel.md#level-2-synchron-tuner) 
    * Stardust Synchron => Arrive in Light 
    * Junk Speeder + Junk Synchron => Stardust Dragon
    * Stardust Dragon + Arrive in Light => Converging Wills Dragon
    * Level 1 & Level 2 => Crystron Halqifibrax 
    * Crystron Halqifibrax => Formula Synchron 
    * Stardust Dragon + Formula Synchron + Converging Wills Dragon => Shooting Majestic Star Dragon

# Converging Wishes
* I've never been able to summon 5 Dragon Synchron monsters. 

# Majestic Absorption
* Might be fun to try out. 

# Majestic Dragon
* Majestic Dragon
* Converging Wills Dragon
* Looks like Converging Wills Dragon is a direct upgrade. 

## Converging Wills Dragon
* If I have Stardust Dragon, I can bring out Stardust Xiaolong from my deck to get Majestic Star Dragon

## Majestic Red Dragon
* I don't really have Red Dragon Archfiend cards yet. 

## Majestic Star Dragon
* Stardust Dragon + Converging Wills Dragon + Stardust Xiaolong => Majestic Star Dragon

## Shooting Majestic Star Dragon
* Stardust Dragon + Formula Synchron => Shooting Star Dragon + [Majestic Dragon](#majestic-dragon) => Shooting Majestic Star Dragon

# Majestic Mirage
* Even if my conditions are met, I still would have to depend on my opponent triggering it. 

# Shooting Star
* I have more reliable ways of triggering a destruction. 

# Shooting Star Dragon
* Stardust Dragon + Formula Synchron
* Crystron Halqifibrax can bring out Formula Synchron on the opponent's turn and Formula Synchron can trigger a synchro summon on the opponent's turn. 

# Stardust Assault Warrior
* Junk Forward + Junk Synchron into Stardust Assault Warrior. Get back Junk Synchron to make a Level 9 Synchro monster. I don't have a such a monster that I care about. 

# Stardust Chronicle Spark Dragon
* I don't see why I would play this over Shooting Star Dragon. And I rarely ever get to play Shooting Star Dragon. 

# Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode
* I hate how if I draw this, it becomes a dead card. It needs to stay in my deck to be useful and I have to have Assault Mode Activate and I have to have Stardust Dragon out. That's a lot of requirements.

# Stardust Flash
* A weaker [Reborn](#reborn)

# Stardust Shimmer
* This seems like a worst Monster Reborn unless I use cards that gains advantage for having cards out of play. 

# Stardust Spark Dragon
* It can survive Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer, but it can't beat it. 
* It's a generally neat card, but I can't think of what I would take out for it. I would rather have Stardust Dragon, Junk Destroyer, and Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon

# Stardust Trail
* What do I have that Tributes? 

# Stardust Wish
* I don't get my Stardust out often enough to use this. 

# Stardust Xiaolong
* This makes an interesting facedown. 
* I can get this from my deck if I draw Converging Wills Dragon and I have a Stardust Dragon on the field. I can get a Majestic Star Dragon from this.
