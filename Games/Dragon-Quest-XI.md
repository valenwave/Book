# Review
As a turn based RPG, it's fun to be able to skip random encounters and just enjoy the story with the occasional intentional training to catch up. Playing in 2D mode re-induces the random encounters, so it's something I'll want to avoid. This will be my reason for not 100% the game, but I think I'll still play the other side-quests. I don't see a reason to play the game again with harder monsters or other restrictions to make the game harder as the story and progression is what makes the game interesting. The story beats are cinematic, and has emotional impact.

Since I can avoid the stuff that I don't like about the game, I say it is a perfect game. 

PS: It's my standard now that if I am to play a turn based RPG, I want my random encounters to be avoidable: Either by dodging or repellents. It's annoying to want to go somewhere fast, but get interrupted and lose your train of thought about what your goal is.
