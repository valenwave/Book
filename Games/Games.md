# Game Design
## Genres
### Hades
I feel like Rogue-like and Rogue-lite is now better defined as a Hades game based on its game. The story, name and feel fits for its genre--you will die, you will start over, forever and ever. Even in beating the game, you will start over.

### Puzzle Platformers
When the core of the game is its puzzle, it's better to remove the jumping and moving aspects of it and have a mobile based--touch-and-drag--experience.

### 2-D Platformers
There's no way to really expand on this genre unless you make it easier or more difficult

# Reviews

## Fortnite
Fun to play events that crosses over with something I enjoy, but the game is repetitive and is only fun if you're winning. 

## Master Duel
I get great joy from evaluating cards and determining how cards can combo into each other. The high level competive scene is better at finding these combos than me and is really oppressive, but I can have fun if I don't strive to be at the top of the game. 

I keep my notes on combos [here](/Games/Master-Duel/Master-Duel.md)
