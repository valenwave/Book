# Synchron Substitute
* Quickdraw Synchron
* Righty Driver
* Junk Anchor

# Accel Synchron
* What can I gain from throwing a Synchron monster from the deck to graveyard? 

# Bri Synchron
* I don't have my 4s so it could be a nice extra monster with Junk Speeder, but I don't want to normally negate my Synchro monster's effect. 

# Drill Warrior
* Might be able to do something fun with throwing a monster into the graveyard temporarly, but the extra deck is too tight for this. 

# Jet Warrior
* With the same materials, I can make Junk Speeder...

# Junk Berserker
* Junk Synchron + Junk Servant
* Quickdraw Synchron + Quillbolt Hedgehog
* Not easy combos and not great payoff. Extra deck is already tight as is. 

# Mono Synchron
* I can turn my Level 4 or lower Warrior or Machine-Type monsters into materials to make Formula Synchron. 
* I would rather get to Forumla Synchron with Crystron Halqifibrax though. 

# Necro Linker
* Not being able to Synchro summon hinders me, but I guess they want me to Link summon instead. 
* This does become a trigger for [Stardust Trail](#stardust-trail)

# Quickdraw Synchron
* If I discard Quillbolt Hedgehog, I can use Quillbolt Hedgehog's ability to bring it right back for a [Level 7 Synchro Monster that mentions "Synchron" Tuner as material](#level-7-synchro-monster-that-mentions-synchron-tuner-as-material)
* It's one of the only level 5 Synchrons that I can use with Junk Speeder. I can't make much with it, but I can link summon Crystron Halqifibrax, but I have to wait a turn. So, I'm not in love with the idea. 

# Righty Driver
* You have to normal summon this one to trigger it's ability. 
* Righty Driver + Junk Servant => Junk Speeder

# Road Synchron
* I like it can become Level 2. It makes an extra Level 2 option for my Junk Speeder. 

## Road Warrior
* I don't see a good way of summoning this guy. 

# Stardust Synchron
* Starlight Road
* Stardust Re-Spark
* Arrive in Light

# Tuning
* I can get Junk Synchron, but I need to already have a level 2 in the graveyard to summon Junk Speeder. Reinforcement of the Army is a better searcher, because I can get Junk Converter. It's still nice to have, it's just not perfect. 
* Jet Synchron
* Junk Synchron
* Satellite Synchron

# Turbo Synchron
* I'm fine with having Jet Synchron in my deck. 

## Turbo Warrior
* Interesting effect, I don't think it matters in the current meta.
