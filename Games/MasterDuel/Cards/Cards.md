# Angel Trumpeter
* Angel Trumpeter + [Level 4 Normal Monster](Master-Duel.md#level-4-normal-monster) = Magikey Spirit - Vepartu

# Astral Kuriboh
* One of my favorite number support card. Allows me to help me get out...
* Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy 
* Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord

# Baby Mudragon
* I don't think I'll miss this card. 

# Burning Soul
* An example is Stardust Dragon or Baronne de Fleur.
* I would need a reason to want to Synchro summon on my opponent's turn to use this, or be on the attack and the opponent decide to play a trap that would destroy my monsters. Situational. 

# Cosmic Blazar Dragon
* Formula Synchron + Stardust Dragon + Assault Blackwing - Sayo the Rain Hider
* Formula Synchron + Stardust Dragon + T.G. Recipro Dragonfly
* Crystron Halqifibrax => Formula Synchron
* Mono Synchron + Quillbolt Hedgedhog => T.G. Recipro Dragonfly
* Mono Synchron + Quillbolt Hedgedhog => Formula Synchron

# Cyber Stein
* Cyber End Dragon
* Blaze Fenix, the Burning Bombardment Bird

# Dinowrestler Pankraptops
* I can destroy an opponent card or I can use it for it's ATK which is higher than Dark Magician

# Eldich the Golden Lord
* If I have any Spell or Traps in my deck, it's always nice to have the option to have Eldich the Golden Lord use it to destroy an opponent card instead. 
* [Spells and traps that works in the graveyard](Master-Duel.md#spells-and-traps-that-works-in-the-graveyard)

# Foolish Burial
* [Benefits in Graveyard](Master-Duel.md#benefits-in-graveyard)

# Forbidden Droplet
* [Benefits in Graveyard](Master-Duel.md#benefits-in-graveyard)

# Lefty Driver
* Junk Speeder + Righty Driver + Lefty Driver => Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier (2 turns)

# Lightning Storm
* Not great if I depend on Field Spells, Continous Spell or Traps, or Pendulum monsters. 
* With Junk Speeder, I have some Continous Spells that helps me keep my combo going. 

# Monster Reborn
* I can bring back Dinowrestler Pankraptops and use it's effect again. 
* I can special summon Starry Night, Starry Dragon if I happen to get it in the graveyard. 
* I can bring back a monster that was destroyed to continue my combo.

# One Day of Peace
* Is fine if I can get Baronne de Fleur out

# One for One
* Righty Driver
* Tuningware

# Thunder King Rai-Oh
* It's a nice restriction for the opponent, would be great to use if it didn't hinder me as well. 
* Synchron doesn't depend too much on [Deck to Hand](Master-Duel.md#deck-to-hand), so it's usable.

# Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier
* This one is not as easy to get out as Crystron Quariongandrax
* Junk Speeder + Quillbolt Hedgehog + [Level 2 Tuner](#level-2-tuner)

# Unexpected Dai
* Galaxy Serpent

# United We Stand
* Junk Speeder can double it's attack to 3600 if I don't want to use it as a stepping stone for a higher Synchro summon. If I put it in my Extra Deck slot, that means I can have 6 monsters for an extra bonus of 4800. That's 8400 total. 

# Ursarctic Septentrion
* Shutsdown non-level decks... Evil Twin. That's not many. 

# Wandering Gryphon Rider
* Wandering Gryphon Rider + Junk Synchron = Baronne de Fleur
* Provides an alternative way to Baronne de Fleur without the need of Junk Synchron. But the extra Synchro summons are fun.
