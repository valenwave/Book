# Keyboard
* A - Bring out weapon
* C - Cast Spell
* U - Use Item
* P - Picklock
* M - Map

# Magic Item
* Magicial items are indicated as blue. Weapons, Crystals, and Rings can be magicial. 
* You can apprise magicial items at the mage guild but it looks like the apprisal will go away, so might as well save the game, apprise, take notes and reload the save. The magicial effect of the item works whether or not the apprisal is done. 

# Locks
* If you're not a thief, you'll have a hard time unlocking doors through normal means. As a mage or warrior, you can just bash doors open at the cost of wearing down the weapon.
