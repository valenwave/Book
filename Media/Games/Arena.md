# Play style
Being a thief is terrible in this game as there is no way to avoid crime. Crime is random and getting caught for a crime means you'll most likely have to reload your save file. 

Even with an easy lock, it could take awhile to unlock something. Best to lockpick in dungeons instead of in token. 

# Attack
