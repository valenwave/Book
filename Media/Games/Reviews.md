# Dead Cells
I've played Enter the Gungeon and enjoyed it, but this game gives me a deeper sense of dread. I think it's because you lose progress on death that upgrades doesn't stick until you get to a checkpoint, and that combat is much more up close and personal so you don't really get a chance to know how things will hurt you until they do. Because of that death is necessary for learning and it's hard to just learn by studying. 

# Dragon Quest XI
As a turn based RPG, it's fun to be able to skip random encounters and just enjoy the story with the occasional intentional training to catch up. Playing in 2D mode re-induces the random encounters, so it's something I'll want to avoid. This will be my reason for not 100% the game, but I think I'll still play the other side-quests. I don't see a reason to play the game again with harder monsters or other restrictions to make the game harder as the story and progression is what makes the game interesting. The story beats are cinematic, and has emotional impact.

Since I can avoid the stuff that I don't like about the game, I say it is a perfect game. 

PS: It's my standard now that if I am to play a turn based RPG, I want my random encounters to be avoidable: Either by dodging or repellents. It's annoying to want to go somewhere fast, but get interrupted and lose your train of thought about what your goal is. 

# Fortnite
Fun to play events that crosses over with something I enjoy, but the game is repetitive and is only fun if you're winning. 

# Master Duel
I get great joy from evaluating cards and determining how cards can combo into each other. The high level competive scene is better at finding these combos than me and is really oppressive, but I can have fun if I don't strive to be at the top of the game. 

I keep my notes on combos [here](/Games/Master-Duel/Master-Duel.md)
