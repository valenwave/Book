# Ghostrick
* [Backrow](../Master-Duel.md#backrow)
* [Trap](../Master-Duel.md#trap)
* [Floodgate](../Master-Duel.md#floodgate)
* [Conseal](../Master-Duel.md#conceal)
* [Direct attack]
* [Field Spell]
* [Continuous Trap]

# Ghostrick Lantern
* Negate attack handtrap. It doesn't flip the monster face down though and therefore doesn't lock the monster. 

# Ghostrick Yuki-onna
* Floodgate on death instead of summon. 
* Works okay without any of my field spells, but once I have a field spell, it is much harder for this to die and my effect to trigger.

---

# Ghostrick Field Spell
## Ghostrick Mansion
* Half retaliation damage.
* The only version that is splashable with other archetypes

## Ghostrick Museum
* Pairs well with [Ghostrick Night](#ghostrick-night).
* Only Ghostrick can attack

## Ghostrick Parade
* Allows me to get lots of Ghostrick monsters, but I can't do damage in the process. 
* My monsters can attack, but it won't do damage. 

---

# Ghostrick or Treat
* Requires a [Ghostrick Field Spell](#ghostrick-field-spell)

# Ghost-Go-Round
* Either [flip facedown](../Master-Duel.md#flip-facedown) or force attack

# Ghostrick Renovation
* Allows me to switch field spells. It's nice, but I could use the room for something else. 

# Ghostrick Night
* Requires me to have a [Ghostrick](#ghostrick) monster face up in attack, which means it doesn't get the defense from [Ghostrick Museum](#ghostrick-museum) and requires me to play [negate attack](../Master-Duel.md#negate-attack). But the upgrade on [conseal](../Master-Duel.md#conceal) effects sounds worth it.
* Provides [floodgate](../Master-Duel.md#floodgate) effect for cards put facedown. So it pairs well with [conseal](../Master-Duel.md#conceal) 

# Ghostrick Scare
* Pairs well with [Ghostrick Night](#ghostrick-night).

# Ghostrick Vanish
* Provides protection, though I already have plenty of protection from my field spells, and I rather have Ghostrick monsters. 

---

# Subterror Behemoth Speleogeist
* Can be special summoned by Ghostrick effect triggers.

# Subterror Behemoth Ultramafus
* Can be special summoned by Ghostrick effect triggers.

--- 

Flip cards can be protected by Ghostrick Field Spells

# Morphing Jar
* Is projected from Ghostrick field spells

---

# Floodgate Trap Hole
* Keeps them pinned down and plays well with other cards that does the same thing in the archetype

# Swords of Concealing Light
* Draw 2

---

# Performapal Kuribohble
* Hand trap, life gain.

---

# Magic cylinder
* Battle trap

# Rainbow life
* More life gain

# Scrap-Iron Scarecrow
* Annoying trap that forces opponent to deal with. Not perfect because I can still get overrun with too many monsters. Still great to have out. 

---

# Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring
* I know it's meta but there's no synergy here. 

# Crackdown
* Has a fun trick where turning the opponent's monster facedown will allow me to keep it and attack with it, but it's not that easy to set up. 

# Dinowrestler Pankratops
* Good support card

# One Day of Peace
* I'm going to be taking my time anyways

# One for One
* I do have level 1 Ghostrick monsters, but I don't really have monsters that are better in the graveyard. 

# Lord of the Heavenly Prison
* I have traps, but I don't think there are enough of them. 

# Scapeghost
* Tokens can't be used for XYZ summons. 
* If I can flip summon it, I can summon Formula Synchron to draw 1 card. 
* If the opponent only attacked with one monster, I can link summon 4 on my turn.

# Dark Hole
* Potential +4
* However more likely a -1 or 0. 

# Torrential Tribute
* Ghostrick: Bad. I want to protect my investments

# Harpie's Feather Duster
* Potential +4

# Raigeki
* Potential +4
