## Genres
### Hades
I feel like Rogue-like and Rogue-lite is now better defined as a Hades game based on its game. The story, name and feel fits for its genre--you will die, you will start over, forever and ever. Even in beating the game, you will start over.

### Puzzle Platformers
When the core of the game is its puzzle, it's better to remove the jumping and moving aspects of it and have a mobile based--touch-and-drag--experience.

### 2-D Platformers
There's no way to really expand on this genre unless you make it easier or more difficult
